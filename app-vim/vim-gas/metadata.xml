		VIM-GAS

		This vim bundle adds advanced syntax highlighting for GNU as (AT&T) for *86 CPUs.

		This file defines a (almost) complete syntax for GNU as assembler.

		My motivation in writing this was the lack of a complete, working syntax for this common assembler.

		For now the basic as directives as well as the Intel / AMD instruction sets are included. Opcodes supporting a size suffix are recognized plain as well as suffixed with b/w/l/q.
